<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fusing Resistor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resettable Fuse Resistor</li><li>One-time Fuse Resistor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fusing resistor market is categorized into two main types: resettable fuse resistors and one-time fuse resistors. Resettable fuse resistors can automatically restore functionality after an overcurrent event, making them suitable for applications requiring frequent resets. In contrast, one-time fuse resistors provide a permanent interruption of current flow after a fault occurs, necessitating replacement. Both types serve essential roles in protecting electronic circuits from damage due to excessive current, offering distinct advantages based on application requirements.</p></p>
