<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Atherectomy and Thrombectomy Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rheolytic</li><li>Aspiration</li><li>Rotational</li><li>Ultrasound Device</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Atherectomy and thrombectomy devices are essential in treating vascular blockages. The rheolytic device uses high-velocity saline jets to break up clots, promoting blood flow. Aspiration devices employ suction to remove clots or plaque directly from the vessel. Rotational devices use a rotating cutter to shave away blockages, while ultrasound devices utilize high-frequency sound waves to dissolve clots and improve circulation. Each type offers unique mechanisms for effectively managing cardiovascular conditions and enhancing patient outcomes.</p></p>
