<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Large Scale LNG Terminals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquefaction</li><li>Onshore</li><li>Offshore</li><li>Regasification</li><li>Onshore</li><li>Offshore</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The large scale LNG terminals market consists of several key types. Liquefaction terminals convert natural gas into LNG, enabling efficient transport. Onshore liquefaction plants are built on land, while offshore facilities utilize marine platforms. Regasification terminals reverse the liquefaction process, converting LNG back to gas for distribution. Similar to liquefaction, regasification includes onshore terminals situated on land and offshore units typically located near coastal areas. Each type plays a vital role in the global LNG supply chain.</p></p>
