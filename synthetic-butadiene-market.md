<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Synthetic Butadiene Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oxidative Dehydrogenation</li><li>Extractive Distillation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The synthetic butadiene market features two primary production types: oxidative dehydrogenation and extractive distillation. Oxidative dehydrogenation involves converting butanes or butenes into butadiene using oxygen, facilitating an efficient process with reduced byproducts. Extractive distillation, on the other hand, leverages solvents to separate butadiene from C4 hydrocarbon mixtures, enhancing purity. Both methods cater to the growing demand for synthetic rubber and plastics, impacting industries ranging from automotive to consumer goods, and contributing to market dynamics.</p></p>
